        After you read the above sections, you will be directed to a short quiz which will help you reflect on the strategies presented in this lesson.
    </p>

    <h3>Getting Started</h3>

    <h4>Accessing Library Services</h4>

    <p>
        If you are a newly admitted student and you have not obtained an IIT Hawk Card, details for doing so can be found at the Hawk Card Homepage. You will need your Hawk Card number to access some library services
    </p>

    <p>
        Even if you don't have a Hawk Card, you can still access online journals and perform all of the search functions through the library website. You will only need your Hawk Card to check out materials in person at the Galvin Library or request materials through interlibrary loan. Let's take a look at how to get started.
    </p>

    <h4>Using myIIT to Access the Library Website</h4>
    <p>
        Although you can search for research materials through the library website directly, the best way to access the library website is to first log on to myIIT. Once you are logged in, you will see a link to "Library Resources." Try logging in, and clicking on that link.
    </p>

    <p><img src="illustrations/research2.jpg" alt="research 2"><br>CAPTION: The Library Services icon leads you to the library search website.</p>

    <p>
        Accessing the library website through myIIT allows a proxy server connection which will enable you to access most resources without reentering your login information.
    </p>

    <p>
        Once you are at the library website, you will see a variety of search options available on the left-hand navigation bar.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best place to begin researching is in a scholarly database that allows you to search multiple scholarly journals at once, such as Academic Search Premiere (EBSCO).
    </p>

    <h3>Research Timelines</h3>

    <h4>Formulating a Timeline</h4>

    <p>
        It is important to first consider your due date when thinking about requesting resources. You must have enough time to read the material, integrate it into your project or paper, and still have time to finish your assignment. In general, consider this formula when determining whether it is realistic to use a resource for your paper:
    </p>

    <p><b>
        Time to obtain resource + Time to read resource + Time to integrate resource into your project < Remaining time before deadline
    </b></p>

    <p>
        Let's unpack some of those terms
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Time to obtain resource:</b> How long will it take for the resource to arrive via interlibrary loan? -or- How long will it take for you to physically obtain the resource?</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Time to read resource:</b> How long will it take you to read the book or article? Are you at a point in your project where you must begin to write if you want to finish on time?</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Time to integrate resource into your project:</b> Even if you are able to read the resource, do you have enough time to identify pertinent information and incorporate that information into your project? If your paper is already written, do you have enough time to restructure it to allow for discussion of this resource, or would it simply be better to indicate your awareness of the resource with an explanation that time constraints prevented you from including it?</li>
        <br>
        <li><b>Remaining time before deadline:</b> How much time is left before you must turn in your project? Is your resource powerful enough to cause you to rethink your approach to your topic? If so, requesting an extension might be in order.</li>
    </ul>

        Being Realistic
        <br><br>
        Don't assume that you can read an entire scholarly book in one day. You're only fooling yourself and wasting your precious time if you try to obtain resources that you can't possibly hope to read within your research timeline.

    <h4>Case Study: Example of a Research Timeline</h4>

    <p>
        Bridgette is a graduate student in the Tech Comm program who has been assigned a literature review and research paper for a graduate course. She's decided to research the development of technical communication as a field between the beginning of the twentieth century up to World War II.
    </p>

    <p>
        Her first move is to begin researching by logging into myIIT and searching for articles using scholarly databases like EBSCO and JSTOR. After conducting some research, she finds several articles that are pertinent to her search topic, but are not available as a .pdf download through those databases. She knows that she must decide whether it is worthwhile for her to request those resources or to move on and look for resources that are more easily available. To do this, she constructs a research timeline.
    </p>

    <p>
        Having conducted research projects before, she knows that she need not write down her timeline, but she decides to set reasonable goals and record them in her Google calendar so that she has an idea of when certain elements of her project should be completed. She first concludes that she has started with plenty of time to request any resources that she needs to complete the project, and that she will have sufficient time to wait for resources to arrive, read them, and incorporate what she has learned into her paper before she must turn in her final copy. She decides to read these articles when they arrive, and then expand her research to cover her topic as appropriate.
